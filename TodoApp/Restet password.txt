If you've forgotten your password and only have the hashed version stored in your database, you won't be able to retrieve the original password from the hash due to the nature of hashing (it's a one-way function). However, you can reset your password. Here’s how you can do it:

### Steps to Reset Your Password

1. **Create a Password Reset Endpoint**: You can create an endpoint in your FastAPI application that allows you to reset your password.

2. **Generate a New Hashed Password**: When resetting the password, hash the new password and update the existing user record in the database.

### Example Code for Password Reset

Here’s an example of how you might implement a password reset feature in your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import sqlite3
import bcrypt

app = FastAPI()

class PasswordReset(BaseModel):
    username: str
    new_password: str

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed.decode('utf-8')

@app.post("/reset-password/")
async def reset_password(reset: PasswordReset):
    hashed_password = hash_password(reset.new_password)

    # Connect to your SQLite database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Update the user's password in the database
    cursor.execute("""
        UPDATE users
        SET hashed_password = ?
        WHERE username = ?
    """, (hashed_password, reset.username))

    if cursor.rowcount == 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

    return {"message": "Password updated successfully"}
```

### How to Use the Password Reset Endpoint

1. Send a POST request to `/reset-password/` with a JSON body containing your username and the new password:

   ```json
   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "new_password": "your_new_password"
   }
   ```

2. The endpoint will hash the new password and update it in the database.

### Important Notes

- **Security**: Ensure that this endpoint is secured. You might want to implement additional checks, such as email verification or a security question, to prevent unauthorized password resets.
- **Testing**: Test the endpoint thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and handles errors properly.
