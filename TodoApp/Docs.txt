FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation for your application,
making it easy to understand and test your endpoints. Here's how to use the FastAPI
documentation effectively:

### Accessing the Documentation

1. **Default Documentation URLs**:
   - **Swagger UI**: Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your web browser.
   This provides a user-friendly interface to explore your API.
   - **ReDoc**: Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` for an alternative documentation
    style that is also automatically generated.

### Features of FastAPI Documentation

1. **Endpoint Overview**:
   - The documentation lists all available endpoints, including their HTTP methods
   (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

2. **Request and Response Models**:
   - For each endpoint, you can see the expected request body format, including any
    required fields, as defined by Pydantic models.
   - The response models are also displayed, showing what the API will return.

3. **Interactive Testing**:
   - You can test endpoints directly from the Swagger UI:
     - Click on an endpoint to expand it.
     - Fill in any required parameters or request body.
     - Click the "Execute" button to send a request and view the response.

4. **Authentication**:
   - If your API requires authentication (e.g., OAuth2, API keys), you can usually
    provide the necessary credentials directly from the documentation interface.

5. **Parameter Descriptions**:
   - Each parameter is documented, including its type, whether itâ€™s required,
   and a description of its purpose.

### Customizing Documentation

You can customize your FastAPI documentation by using the following parameters when
creating the FastAPI app instance:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI(
    title="Your API Title",
    description="A brief description of your API",
    version="1.0.0",
    terms_of_service="http://example.com/terms/",
    contact={
        "name": "Your Name",
        "url": "http://example.com/contact",
        "email": "your.email@example.com",
    },
    license_info={
        "name": "MIT License",
        "url": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",
    },
)
```

### Tips for Using FastAPI Documentation

1. **Keep Models Updated**:
   - Ensure your Pydantic models are well-defined and up-to-date,
   as they directly impact the documentation.

2. **Use Descriptions**:
   - Add descriptions to your endpoints and parameters to make the documentation
    clearer for users.

3. **Versioning**:
   - Consider versioning your API to help users understand changes over time.

4. **Testing**:
   - Use the interactive features to test endpoints during development.
   This can help catch errors before they reach production.

### Summary

FastAPI's automatic documentation is a powerful tool for both development
and user interaction. By accessing the Swagger UI or ReDoc, you can easily
explore and test your API, making it an essential part of working with FastAPI.
Customize your documentation to enhance clarity and usability for your API consumers.
